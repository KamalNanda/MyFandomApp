The game was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 in November 2007 and for PC in April 2008. The game centers around the use of a machine dubbed the 'Animus', which allows its user to view the genetic memories of his or her ancestors, centering around the protagonist, a bartender named Desmond Miles. As Desmond relives the memories of one of his ancestors, the Assassin Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad who lived in the Holy Land during the Third Crusade, details of a battle between two ancient sects – the Knights Templar and the Assassin Order – emerge as both scour for an artifact known only as a 'Piece of Eden'. Assassin's Creed received primarily positive reviews, for both its story and its gameplay, and received several awards at 2006's E3. In November 2009, a sequel in the form of Assassin's Creed II was released, building on the foundation set by Assassin's Creed"

A direct sequel to Assassin's Creed, the game focuses again on Desmond Miles after he escapes from Abstergo Industries with the help of employee Lucy Stillman. In an attempt to thwart Abstergo and the modern-day Templars, Desmond uses a new Animus to relive the genetic memories of his ancestor, Ezio Auditore da Firenze, who lived in Italy during the Renaissance. The player controls Desmond to a degree, but primarily Ezio, who becomes an Assassin after his family is betrayed. While controlling Ezio, the player can explore renditions of major Italian regions and cities through a mixture of action, stealth, and economic gameplay. On 16 November 2010, a follow-up in the form of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood was released, expanding on both Ezio's life and the modern day storyline. A remastered version of the game was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One as part of The Ezio Collection in November 2018."
